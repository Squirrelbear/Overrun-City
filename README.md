# Overrun City

A single tiny level 2D shooter where the player must enter a code by shooting the numbers. Developed as a mini-project during a 3rd year uni game development topic to demonstrate knowledge of using XNA with C#. The game can be played with either a keyboard and mouse or xbox controller.

See the PDF "Overrun City Documentation" for brief details further showing what to do during the mini-game.
